# ReadCSV

This project reads data from a .csv file

## Getting Started

Clone the project into your folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/whoismarios/AngularReadCSV.git
```

Change the directory
```bash
cd AngularReadCSV
```

Install all dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Run the dev server and open the browser at http://localhost:4200
```bash
ng serve --open
```


I also provided some fake data inside the 'Fake Data' folder.
You can use of course your own .csv file
