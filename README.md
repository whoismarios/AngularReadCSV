# ReadCSV (Angular PWA)

This project reads data from a .csv file

## Getting Started

### Clone the project into your folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/whoismarios/AngularReadCSV.git
```

### Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Change the directory
```bash
cd AngularReadCSV
```

### Install all dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Run the dev server and open the browser at http://localhost:4200
```bash
ng serve --open
```


I also provided some fake data inside the 'Fake Data' folder.
You can use of course your own .csv file

You can still use the Application even when you stop the server.
The name of the recently uploadet files gets stored in the Localstorage.
